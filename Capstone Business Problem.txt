Business Problem:

The problem that I decided to investigate in this project is to determine the optimal and desired location and type of venue in Alberta.

The stakeholders of this problem are investors who are looking to establish a new venue somewhere in Alberta, Canada for potential returns.

In the process, the postal code data of Alberta will be looked up (similar to how Toronto data was explored) and the venues in each corresponding
postal code will be taken into account.

A list of trending venues will be looked at and their positions and category will be evaluated.



The end goal to this project is to figure out which neighbourhood and category is optimal for the stakeholders to open a business in.
